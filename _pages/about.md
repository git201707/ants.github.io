I graduated from [Huanggang Normal University](https://www.hgnu.edu.cn/) with a major in Physics and obtained a Master's degree in Modern Educational Technology from [Hebei University](https://hbu.edu.cn/). My work experience includes but is not limited to being a teacher, teaching and research manager, information technology researcher, assistant teaching and research officer, and project manager.

I am fortunate to have participated in national teacher capacity improvement projects at the school and city levels, as well as the national key project of the [Advanced Innovation Center for Future Education of Beijing Normal University](https://aic-fe.bnu.edu.cn/en/about/index.html) Integration Application Laboratory. I am also fortunate to have participated in the university enterprise curriculum resource construction project.
